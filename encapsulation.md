# Encapsulation

Ther is an OOP defintion of encapsulation that is the bundling together of
logic and data in an object, I'm not discussing that here.

Instead I'm discussing encapsulation in the more basic sense of hiding details
behind interfaces, be those actual language level interfaces, network protocols
or simply functions. 

Encapsulation is important because it keeps the scope of what you need to understand small, and
